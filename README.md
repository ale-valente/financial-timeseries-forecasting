# Deep Learning Neural Network: Financial Timeseries Forecasting [Python]
Deep Learning Neural Network: Financial Timeseries Forecasting written in Python using Google Colab IDE (or Jupyter Notebook). I've used a deep neural network (Bidirectional LSTM + Convolutional Layers) to predict the behavior of several uncorrelated input time series.

Data is not available here on Github (too large file for this platform). The data contains 48000 time series of 2776 values between 0 and 1 (with 0-padding at the begining) and different categories of each time series. The data is stored in 3 Numpy array files: "training_data.npy", "valid_periods.npy" and "categories.npy".
